    <h2>WASTE MANAGEMENT:</h2>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
</div>
<div class="hover-effect">
    <p>Waste management encompasses a comprehensive approach to handling the materials we discard, aiming to minimize environmental impact and promote sustainability. It involves practices like reducing waste at its source, reusing items whenever possible, recycling materials to reclaim valuable resources, and composting organic waste to create nutrient-rich soil. Modern waste management also explores waste-to-energy technologies, converting non-recyclable waste into electricity or heat, thereby reducing reliance on landfills. Effective waste management requires collaboration among governments, businesses, communities, and individuals, each playing a critical role in reducing the environmental footprint. Through education, policy-making, and innovative technologies, we can achieve more efficient waste management practices that not only reduce pollution but also conserve resources for future generations</p>

    <h2>HOW DOMESTIC WASTE EFFECT HUMANS:</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="baddu">
    <br>
    <p>Health Risks: Improperly managed domestic waste can lead to the proliferation of disease vectors such as flies, rodents, and mosquitoes, which can spread diseases like malaria, dengue fever, and cholera. Accumulated waste can also attract pests and vermin that pose health risks to humans.

        Air Pollution: Burning of domestic waste, especially plastics and other synthetic materials, releases harmful pollutants into the air, including particulate matter, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and toxic gases like dioxins and furans. Prolonged exposure to air pollution can cause respiratory problems, aggravate existing conditions like asthma, and increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
        
        Water Contamination: Improper disposal of domestic waste, including dumping of untreated sewage and chemicals into water bodies or groundwater, can lead to water pollution. Contaminated water sources pose serious health risks, causing waterborne diseases such as diarrhea, typhoid, and hepatitis.
